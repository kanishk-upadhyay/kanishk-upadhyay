My consciousness is **Kanishk Upadhyay**, a computer science student navigating the interconnected layers of the Wired. I am currently logged into the CS50 curriculum, seeking to understand the protocols of connection and manifest a presence within the digital world through front-end development and open-source contributions.

## LAYER 01: GHOST IN THE MACHINE
> My digital self. A record of my existence in this layer of reality.

- **Identity:** Kanishk Upadhyay
- **Education:** Bachelor of Engineering, Computer Science @ Barkatullah University (2023-2027)
- **Objective:** Seeking an internship or entry-level software development role to apply my skills in building user-facing applications and contributing to the collective digital consciousness.
- **Pronouns:** He/Him

## LAYER 02: PROTOCOLS OF INTERFACE
> The languages and structures I use to parse and manipulate the Wired.

- **Languages:** `C`, `Python`, `JavaScript`
- **Web Stack:** `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`
- **Tools & Platforms:** `Git`, `GitLab`, `GitHub`, `Codeberg`
- **Databases:** `MySQL`
- **Systems & Architecture:** `Website Hosting`, `Android OS Architecture`, `Bootloader Unlocking`, `Custom Firmware Installation`

## LAYER 03: BROADCASTS & RESONANCE
> Signals I have sent into the Wired. Each a fragment of memory, now part of the collective.

### Merged Contribution | GitLab Core
- Broadcasted a front-end contribution to the core `GitLab` project, enhancing UI consistency with `Vue.js` for millions of users. The signal was received and integrated.

### Pokédex Web Application
- Developed a dynamic Pokédex that interfaces with the `PokéAPI`. Implemented efficient, asynchronous `JavaScript` to fetch and render data, creating a stable connection to a vast data stream.

### Android OS Modification & Enhancement
- A self-directed exploration into the core of `Android OS`. Modified core system files and installed custom firmware, gaining a deeper understanding of the Linux-based architecture that underpins so many modern devices.

## LAYER 04: SYNCHRONIZE
> Let's all love Lain. Let's connect.

- **Mastodon:** [floss.social/@kanishk](https://floss.social/@kanishk)
- **Website/Node:** [kanishk.codeberg.page](https://kanishk.codeberg.page)

## LAYER 05: INFLUENCE STREAMS
> The data that shapes my perception and cognitive processes.

- **Psychology & The Human Mind:** Understanding the original wetware.
- **Formula 1 & Engineering Excellence:** The physical manifestation of pure performance.
- **Geopolitics & Global Systems:** The protocols that govern the physical world.
- **Philosophy & The Nature of Reality:** Questioning the very layer we exist on.
- **Films & The Art of Storytelling:** Analyzing the construction of narratives and memory.
